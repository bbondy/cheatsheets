Setup Google Cloud Platform (GCP) kubernetes instance:  


# Definitions:
- Pod: A Pod is a collection of application containers and volumes running in the same execution environment. Pods not containers the the smallest deployable artifact in a Kubernetes cluster. All containers in a pod land on the same machine. Things within a pod have the same IP, hostname, and port space. An application and its database don't necessarily make up a pod because they scale differently and can be on different machines.
- Container: A container is a lightweight, stand-alone, and executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, a runtime environment, libraries, and system tools.
- Kubernetes client: `kubernetes` is for interacting with the Kubernetes API. Used to manage most Kubernetes objects, such as Pods, ReplicaSets, and Services.
- Namespaces:  Namespaces are like folders to organize objects in the cluster.  

# Restful path:  
Each Kubernetes object exists at a unique Restful HTTP path;
Each object is represented as a JSON or yaml file.

# YAML or JSON files to create, update, or delete objects on the Kubernetes server:  
Create or apply if different:  
`kubectl apply -f obj.yaml # The resource type is obtained from the yaml`

`--dry-run` can be passed to see which changes would be made  
Delete an object:  
`kubectl delete -f obj.yaml`


# Pods

## See the pods usage (application level):  
`kubectl top pods`

## Get Pods:
`kubectl get pods`  

## Deleting a pod:
`kubectl delete pods/<pod-name>`

## Creating a pod:
`kubectl run <pod-name> --generator=run-pod/v1 --image=gcr.io/<image-path>/<pod-name>-amd64:blue`

## Execute a command in a running instance:  
`kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- bash`

## Copy files to and from a pod:  
`kubectl cp <pod-name>:</path/to/remote/file> </path/to/local/file>`

## Forward traffic from local machine on port 8080 to remote container on port 80:
`kubectl port-forward <pod-name> 8080:80`

## Example pod manifest:
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: kuard
spec:
  containers:
    - image: gcr.io/kuar-demo/kuard-amd64:blue
      name: kuard
      ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
          name: http
          protocol: TCP
```
The metadata section describes the pod name and its labels.
The spec section lists out all the containers and volumes that make up this pod.


# Other commands:

```
## Set a default zone
gcloud config set compute/zone us-west1-a

## Create a cluster (must have Kubernetes Engine API enabled, otherwise the command will fail and tell you how to enable it)
gcloud container clusters create kuar-cluster --num-nodes=3

## Get credentials for the cluster
gcloud container clusters get-credentials kuar-cluster
```

## Delete an object using resource type and name:  
`kubectl delete <resource-name> <obj-name>`



## Getting logs to debug:  
`kubectl logs <pod-name>`

## Version of local kubectl tool and version of Kubernetes API server:   
`kubectl version`

Example output:  
  
> Client Version: v1.28.2  
> Kustomize Version: v5.0.4-0.20230601165947-6ce0bf390ce3  
> Server Version: v1.27.3-gke.100  
  
## To get general diagnostics:  
`kubectl get componentstatuses`


## Get running nodes:  
`kubectl get nodes`

## Get information about a specific node:  
`kubectl describe nodes kube1`


Deploy deployment and service manifest to your kubernetes cluster:  
Deploy: `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml`
Expose: `kubectl apply -f service.yaml`

Check everything is running correctly:â€¨  
Get Deployments: `kubectl get deployments`  
Get Services: `kubectl get services`  
Can also be combined: `kubectl get pods,services`  
To get more detailed info about a particular object: `kubectl describe <resource-name> <obj-name>`  
Supported fields for a Kubernetes object: `kubectl explain pods`  
Watch changes over time: `kubectl get pods --watch`  

## View kubernetes events:  
`kubectl get events`

## See how the cluster is using resources (machine level):  
`kubectl top nodes`

## Stop future pods from being scheduled onto that machine:  
`kubectl cordon`

Re-enable pod scheduling on the node:  
`Kubectl uncordon`

Remove any pods that are currently running on that machine:  
`kubectl drain`

Vscode plugin:  
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-kubernetes-tools.vscode-kubernetes-tools

Send input to the running process:  
`kubectl attach -it <pod-name>`

Namespaces:  
kubectl takes these command line parameters for dealing with namespaces:  
```
--namespace=mystuff
--all-namespaces
```

Contexts:  
To change a namespace, user, and clusters more permanently, use contexts.  
Contexts live on the filesystem usually in:  
` ~/.kube/config`

Creating a new context with a different context  
`kubectl config set-context my-context --namespace=mystuff`

And to change the current context:  
`kubectl config use-context my-context`

Using JSONPath to extract the IP address of a specified pod:  
`kubectl get pods my-pod -o jsonpath --template={.status.podIP}`
